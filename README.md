# Fibonacci sequence

This repository contains two implementations of Fibonacci sequence in Python3. First one is rather boring and well known, using generator function to yield consequent elements of the sequence.

The second implementation was prepared in my favourite IDE for Python, namely Adobe Photoshop. As this is a tooploox challenge I wanted to include their logo into my implementation.

Here it is the final result, my take on Fibonacci sequence in Python:

Just add the image into your system PATH and import `fibonacci` function from `tooploox_logo_overcomplicated_fibonacci` module. File `overcomplicated_fibonacci.py` provides an example of steps mentioned above.

Contact me for more details about my implementation and to know more about graphical software development using IDEs like MS Paint I suggest looking into [Gynvael's Python 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VJaprmuHcw) introduction.
